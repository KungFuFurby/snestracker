Contributing
============

As was mentioned from the SNES Tracker [README](./README.md), contributions from the open source community are welcome, as long contributions are made with clear understanding of the following points:

- Contributing to SNES Tracker does not entitle the contributor to profits on
SNES Tracker sales.
- The contributor implicitly grants Bazz the necessary rights to their contribution such that Bazz can legally relicense the SNES Tracker software.
